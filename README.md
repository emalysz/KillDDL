# KillDDL
KillDDL is an android application that keeps track of deadlines. We enable users to add, edit, and delete deadlines. 

Directions:

1a. Sign up with a new user (ensure proper internet connection to connect to Google Play services)
    a) email with "@"
    b) password with 6+ characters
1b. Sign in with pre-populated user
    user = nicole@gmail.com
    pass = tester123
1c. Sign in with Facebook

Improved capabilities: 
  
  - Drag-and-drop: We were able to implement drag-and-drop to change the priority of a deadline in Calendar View. 
     A user can now drag a deadline to the top if they would like to change the deadline's priority. 
  - Weekly frequency: An additional option for the user aside from daily and monthly frequency. 
  - Delete by swiping: A user can now swipe a deadline or click the red trash can icon to delete it. 
  - Push notifications: A user can have the option to receive push notifications that will show up on the Android device. 
  - Twitter login: In addition to creating a new account and connecting through Facebook, a user can now login through Twitter as well.
