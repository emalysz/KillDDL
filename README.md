# KillDDL
KillDDL is an android application that keeps track of deadlines. We enable users to add, edit, and delete deadlines. 

Directions:

1a. Sign up with a new user (ensure proper internet connection to connect to Google Play services)
  a) email with "@"
  b) password with 6+ characters
1b. Sign in with pre-populated user
  user = nicole@gmail.com
  pass = tester123
1c. Sign in with Facebook

2. After signing in, you will be navigated to Monthly View where you can:
    a) add deadlines
    b) delete deadlines
    c) view deadlines
    
3. From Monthly View you can navigate to Daily View by selecting a date on the calendar and pressing 'Daily' button at the top
(otherwise you will be redirected to the current date's Daily View)

4. On Daily View you can:
  a) add deadlines
  b) select to view a deadline
  c) delete deadlines
  
5. Once a deadline is selected, you will be navigated to the Deadline View where you can:
  a) mark deadline as 'Complete'
  b) return to the Calendar View
  c) edit deadline
  d) delete deadline
  
  
  Notes:
  
  - For Drag-and-Drop feature: We were able to implement drag-and-drop to change the priority of a deadline in Calendar View. 
  However, it negatively affected other app functionality. This is a feature we plan to correctly implement in the next 
  sprint. We have a commit on the branch 'CarolineCalendar' where you can view this feature.
  - Frequency: Be aware that setting a high-frequency deadline, such as daily, will populate the calendar and deadline list 
  with multiple deadlines.
